# ReflowMaster 3D files for the Case

Reflow Master is my open source toaster oven reflow controller that I also sell full assembled on tindie:

It's custom hardware and custom code but all open source so if you want the challenge of making one yourself or you want to hack the code, go for it!

I have a live stream build of the board here if you want to see what's involved

# STL files for 3D printing

Included in this folder are 3 versions of the Reflow Master case.

Functionally, the Rev1 and Rev2 are the same, but the Rev2 has a nicer, more modern look, and locations for the power switch and nuts for the screws print better.

There is also a Rev2 5.08mm version of the case that is bigger than the other Rev2, and that is because I am now shipping the latest version of my Reflow Master with 5.08m screw terminals, which requires extra space inside to fit.

**NOTE:** Do not print the exhaust fan in PLA, please use PET-G or ABS as PLA warps/melts at a low temp. Also DO NOT connect the 3D printed exhaust fan directly to the metal of teh oven, it will melt and ruin your oven. You will need to add some heat resistant insulator between the metal and the 3D print. 

Enjoy!

# Back me on Patreon?
I love making and designing projects but sharing open source projects takes a lot of thought and time. I do it because I think itâ€™s important to share knowledge and give back to the community like many have done before me.

If you find this project useful or want to see more open source projects like it, please consider backing me on Patreon to say thanks!
