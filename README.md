# ReflowMaster

Reflow Master is my open source toaster oven reflow controller that I also sell full assembled on tindie:

It's custom hardware and custom code but all open source so if you want the challenge of making one yourself or you want to hack the code, go for it!

I have a live stream build of the board here if you want to see what's involved

# ReflowMaster Design Files

Inlcluded in this reposity:
- EagleCAD schematics and Board layout files (Eagle 9.1) 
- Exported Gerber files (Gerber 274X)
- STL files for the 3D printed case
- Adrduino code

# Hacking the code
The Reflow Master board presents itself as an "Adafruit Feather M0" - so you'll need to have the Adafruit Cortex m0 hardware profiles installed.

You can find all of the Adafruit hardware by adding this to your Arduino IDE preferences in the "Additional Boards Manager" spot

Enjoy!

# Buy me a coffee?
I love making and designing projects but sharing open source projects takes a lot of thought and time. I do it because I think itâ€™s important to share knowledge and give back to the community like many have done before me.

If you find this project useful or want to see more open source projects like it, please consider a donation to say thanks!
